# Styles

The styles section includes both CSS and SCSS files that define the visual appearance of the components and layouts.

## CSS Stylesheets

- **Bootstrap CSS:** [bootstrap5.3.css](styles/bootstrap5.3.css)
- **Bootstrap Minified CSS:** [bootstrap5.3.min.css](styles/bootstrap5.3.min.css)

These files provide the foundational styles for the project, ensuring responsive and consistent design.

## SCSS Files

- **SCSS Directory:** [scss/](styles/scss/)

The SCSS files contain individual styles for components, allowing for customization and scalability. They are organized to facilitate easy updates and maintenance.
